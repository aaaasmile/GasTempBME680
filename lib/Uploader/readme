Here there is a need of a file that defines the wifi credential:
The file is called secret.txt and it is defined:

#define STASSID "My SSID"
#define STAPSK  "my secret ssid password"


#define HOSTFORCONN "<host>"
#define PORTFORCONN <port>
#define FINGERPRINTMYSRV "something like 4a 2d ....";
#define PUBDATALINK "<link>"

#define SENSOR_GUID_MY "<device token>"
